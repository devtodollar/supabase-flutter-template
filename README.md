## About Me

I'm Matt, the creator of this boilerplate and a former CTO of a YC backed company. Throughout my journey, I went from $0 - $10k of revenue 2 separate times. Before my third time I wanted to create a startup template for building apps (Flutter / Supabase) to expedite this process. I figured that this template could help a lot of other people as well so I decided to clean it up and share it with the world!

## Pricing

I open sourced the code but decided to close source the detailed documentation. You could either **spend 20+ hours** piecing together documentation from separate websites or support me and purchase detailed guides to get you up and running in 17 minutes.

**Early Bird Special:** Prices will go up by $50 on April 20th.
